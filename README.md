## Overview

This repository contains Python code for the 2020 International Math Modeling Challenge (IMMC) in April, a 5 day math modeling competition. 
Our team 9539 was one of the finalists in the competition.

The competiton required us to submit a paper with a short summary of our solution to the problem. You can find our paper 
[here](http://users.wpi.edu/~rabdulhai/docs/IMMC_Paper.pdf).

[Here](https://youtu.be/BCxoNBQ9oNk) is a demo of the simulation I developed in Python that models the products damaged for various store layouts. 
We modeled population density, product density, obstruction of view from cashiers, and number of customers to develop a scoring system to predict 
the total number of damaged products in Black Friday sales. Although we were unable to work together in person this year, we are grateful we had the 
opportunity to collaborate virtually.
